# My E-Commerce Site

Attention! The site is still under construction (I am writing this on March 14, 2025). It does not have all the features presented yet. For example, many category pages have not yet been created or are empty. Many changes will be added from now on. My role in this project was to create a website from scratch by myself, which would include all the possible functionalities for a large-scale e-commerce website. There is still much to add.

## Features

- Product pages and shopping cart
- All products are also added to category pages (phones, headphones, accessories ... etc.) 
- User authentication and registration
- The admin has a special dashboard that only he has access to, protected by a middleware (you will see this in the js server). All routes he will have access to will be protected,will 
  have complete control over the site without having to use code. Will be able to add products, edit products, delete products, manage orders and possibly (I'm still thinking about it) 
  create new category pages. For now, that's all for the admin.
- Integration with payment methods  
- User dashboard (can I see order history, account details, added reviews)
- Users can add product reviews, which will first reach the admin and be reviewed by him.
- Search Bar for users. I created a search bar with postgresql full text search that also involves fuzzy search.
- More features, you will see if you use the site.
